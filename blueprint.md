# Project Blueprint: Local Chatbot with Perplexity.ai-inspired UI

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop a local web application that provides a conversational AI experience similar to ChatGPT. The application will leverage local Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating responses, ensuring data privacy and offline accessibility. The user interface will be designed to mimic the clean, user-friendly aesthetic and information presentation style of Perplexity.ai.

## Features

- **Real-time Conversational Interface:** A dynamic chat interface allowing users to input queries and receive responses instantly.
- **Markdown Rendering:** Support for rendering markdown in responses, including formatting like bold text, italics, lists, and links.
- **Code Block Highlighting:** Automatic syntax highlighting for code blocks within the AI's responses.
- **Streaming Responses (Optional but Desired):** Displaying the AI's response as it is being generated for a more interactive experience.
- **Loading Indicators:** Visual feedback to indicate when the AI is processing a request.
- **Context Management:** Maintaining the conversation history to allow for follow-up questions and contextual understanding.
- **Basic Error Handling:** Graceful handling and display of errors that may occur during processing or model interaction.
- **Local LLM Integration:** Seamless integration with one or more local Large Language Models.
- **Settings for Model Selection (Future Feature):** Ability for the user to select which local LLM to use.
- **Input Area with Typing Indicator (Future Feature):** Showing when the user is typing.

## Design

- **Layout:** A clean and minimalist layout with a clear separation between the input area and the conversation history. Inspired by Perplexity.ai's focused content display.
- **Typography:** Use of legible and modern fonts for both the input and response areas.
- **Color Scheme:** A calming and unobtrusive color palette, prioritizing readability and user comfort.
- **Responsiveness:** The UI should be fully responsive and adapt to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, mobile).
- **Visual Feedback:** Subtle animations and visual cues for actions like sending messages, receiving responses, and loading states.
- **Information Presentation:** Responses should be well-formatted and easy to digest, potentially breaking down complex answers into sections similar to Perplexity.ai's approach (though simplified for a local application).

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:**
    - React
    - Next.js (for server-side rendering and API routes)
    - Tailwind CSS (or similar utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling)
    - Markdown renderer library (e.g., `react-markdown`)
    - Syntax highlighting library (e.g., `react-syntax-highlighter`)
- **Backend:**
    - Node.js
    - Next.js API Routes
    - Library for interacting with local LLMs (e.g., `llama-cpp-js`, bindings for popular local LLM frameworks like Ollama or LM Studio).
- **Local LLM:**
    - Specific LLM to be chosen based on performance, ease of integration, and system requirements (e.g., Llama 2, Mistral, etc.).
    - Consideration of quantization levels (e.g., 4-bit) for better performance on consumer hardware.
